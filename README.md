### About

Nouma Arquitetura is a small architecture firm that specializes in residential designs, and the scope of this project is to make a simple website that contains the presentation of their organization, the four main projects from their library, and their contact info.

The main request for this project is for it to follow the same minimalist-modern style of their own aesthetics and maintain a functional and intuitive UI while adding subtle elements of color and warmth.

The website was an ongoing project before it was halted in April 2024, now being resumed in January 2025. We have repurposed most of the previous work and are soon to launch it.
